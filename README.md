css-tool-belt
=============

A "hammer and nails" CSS tool kit for getting the job done.  This is not a replacement for your grid systems or CSS frameworks, but merely an additional tool for to reduce the amount of plumbing CSS you write.

This tool belt uses SASS, in SCSS syntax to generate the CSS. The outputed CSS file can be found in the /css directory.

> But I dont use SASS?

That's fine. You can just use the CSS file located in the CSS directory. I have not minified this file by default so you can actually inspect the styling your self.
